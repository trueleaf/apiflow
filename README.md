## 💻 Local Development

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: >= 20.0.0
- **MongoDB**: Running locally or accessible remotely
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trueleaf/apiflow.git
cd apiflow
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
# or
npm run bootstrap
```

This will install dependencies for both `packages/web` and `packages/server`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Create or edit configuration files in `packages/server/src/config/` as needed.

4. **Start development servers**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently:
- **Frontend (Web)**: http://localhost:4000
- **Backend (Server)**: http://localhost:7001

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start both frontend and backend in development mode |
| `npm run dev:web` | Start only the frontend |
| `npm run web:dev` | Start only the frontend (alternative) |
| `npm run server:dev` | Start only the backend |
| `npm run web:build` | Build the web application |
| `npm run server:build` | Build the server application |
| `npm run server:test` | Run server unit tests |
| `npm run bootstrap` | Install all dependencies |

### Project Structure

This is a multi-package monorepo:

- `packages/web` - Frontend application (Vite + Vue 3 + Electron)
- `packages/server` - Backend application (Midway.js + MongoDB)
- `packages/website` - Marketing website (Next.js)

### Development Tips

- Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the server
- The frontend supports hot module replacement (HMR) for fast development
- Backend auto-restarts when files change
- You can develop packages independently by running their specific dev commands
